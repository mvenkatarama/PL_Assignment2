</p><p><strong>Important Reminder</strong>: As per the course

<a href="../../misc/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy.html">Academic Honesty Policy</a>, cheating of any kind will minimally
result in your letter grade for the entire course being reduced by one
level.
</p><p>This document first provides the aims of this project.  It then
describes the requirements as explicitly as possible.  It lists the
files with which you have been provided.  Finally, it hints at how
these requirements can be met.
</p><section data-level="h2"><h2>Aims</h2><p>The aims of this project are as follows:
</p><ul><li><p>To expose you to memory allocation.
</p></li><li><p>To give you some familiarity with programming in a low-level
    language.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="require">Requirements</span></h2><p>Implement a program which can add together some number of pairs of
vectors having arbitrary size.  The program must be implemented in
either C, C++ or Rust using the <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code> or <code>cargo</code>/<code>rustc</code>
toolchains available on <code>remote.cs</code>.  Specifically, you must submit a
zip file which will unpack into a <code>prj2-sol</code> directory which will
minimally contain two shell scripts:
</p><dl><dt> <code>prj2-sol/make.sh</code> </dt><dd><p>    Running this script from <strong>any</strong> directory should build your
    program.
</p></dd><dt> <code>prj2-sol/run.sh</code> </dt><dd><p>    When run from <strong>any</strong> directory, this program should run the program
    built by <code>make.sh</code>.  It should require two positive integer
    arguments:
</p><dl><dt> <code>N_OPS</code> </dt><dd><p>        The number of additions to be performed.
</p></dd><dt> <code>N_ENTRIES</code> </dt><dd><p>        The number of entries in each vector.
</p></dd></dl><p>    The program should read <code>N_OPS</code> pairs of vectors
    from standard input.  Each vector is specified as <code>N_ENTRIES</code>
    numbers separated by whitespace.  After each pair of vectors
    is read, the program should write the pairwise sum of the
    two vectors on standard output as follows:
</p><ul><li><p>Each entry in the sum vector is followed by a single
         space <code>' '</code> character.
</p></li><li><p>The output for each sum vector is followed by two
         newline <code>'\n'</code> characters.
</p></li></ul><p>     The program should terminate after performing <code>N_OPS</code> of
     these additions.
</p><p>     [It follows that the program will read a total of <code>N_OPS * 2 *
     N_ENTRIES</code> from standard input and will write out a total <code>2 *
     N_OPS</code> lines to standard output with each non-empty line
     containing <code>N_ENTRIES</code> numbers, each followed by a single space
     <code>' '</code>].
</p></dd></dl><p>Your program is subject to the following implementation restrictions:
</p><ul><li><p>Your program <strong>must</strong> allocate memory for the two addend vectors
    and the sum vector on the heap.  (The use of C's variable-length
    arrays VLAs is not acceptable).
</p></li><li><p>All memory dynamically allocated by your code must be explicitly
    released before program termination.
</p></li><li><p>The sum must first be computed into the sum vector before being
    written to standard output.
</p></li><li><p>Your program should not assume any maximum limits on <code>N_ENTRIES</code>
    beyond those dictated by available memory.
</p></li></ul><p>There is no requirement that your program be 100% robust in reacting
to errors, but &quot;reasonable<code></code>&quot; precautions should be taken. (This
relaxation for error handling is primarily motivated by the difficulty
in handling formatted input in Rust).
</p><p>Your submitted zip file should not contain any binaries or garbage
files unrelated to the functionality of your project.
</p><p>You may assume that your project will be run in a standard Linux
enviroment having the above tool chains.  If in doubt about whether
a particular tool will be available, please check with me.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Provided Files</h2><p>The  <a href="./prj2-sol">prj2-sol</a> directory contains:
</p><dl><dt>  <a href="./prj2-sol/make.sh?lang=sh">make.sh</a> and  <a href="./prj2-sol/run.sh?lang=sh">run.sh</a> </dt><dd><p>    Starter files for the shell scripts you are required to submit.
</p><p>    [These are similar to those you were given for your last project,
    except that they have been hardened against being symlinked.]
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="./prj2-sol/README">README</a></dt><dd><p>    A README file which must be submitted along with your project.  It
    contains an initial header which you must complete (replace the
    dummy entries with your name, B-number and email address at which
    you would like to receive project-related email).  After the
    header you may include any content which you would like read
    during the grading of your project.
</p></dd></dl><p>The  <a href="./extras">extras</a> directory contains auxiliary files associated
with the project, including files which can help with testing your
project.
</p><dl><dt>  <a href="extras/tests">tests</a> </dt><dd><p>    A directory containing tests.  There are two kinds of test files:
</p><dl><dt> <code>*.test</code> </dt><dd><p>      A test input for which your program is expected to succeed.
</p></dd><dt> <code>*.out</code> </dt><dd><p>      The expected pretty-printed output for a successful test of
      the corresponding <code>*.test</code> file.
</p></dd></dl></dd><dt>  <a href="extras/do-tests.sh?lang=sh">do-tests.sh</a> </dt><dd><p>    A shell script which can be used for running the above tests.
    It can be invoked from any directory and takes up to two arguments:
</p><ol><li><p>The path to your <code>run.sh</code> shell script.  
</p></li><li><p>An optional argument giving the path to a single test
         to be run.
</p></li></ol><p>    If invoked with only a single argument, the script will run
    all tests.  If invoked with a second argument, then it will
    run only the test specified by that argument.
</p><p>    [Note that this script invokes your <code>run.sh</code> shell script with
    arguments derived from the name of the <code>*.test</code> file being run].
</p></dd><dt>  <a href="extras/LOG?lang=sh">LOG</a> </dt><dd><p>    A log file illustrating the operation of the project.
</p></dd></dl></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Hints</h2><p>This section is not prescriptive in that you may choose to ignore
it as long as you meet all the project requirements.
</p><p>You may proceed as follows:
</p><ol><li><p>Review the material covered in class on
     <a href="../../slides/runtime/runtime.html">Runtime</a> and the
     <a href="../../slides/runtime/code/matmul">matrix multiplication</a>
    example in particular.  
</p></li><li><p>Read the project requirements thoroughly.
</p></li><li><p>Choose the implementation language for your project.  Some
    considerations:
</p><ul><li><p>C is a simpler language than either C++ or Rust.
</p></li><li><p>Both Rust and C++ are opiniated about how heap memory
        should be managed; C is not.
</p></li><li><p>Rust is the newer language and has had less time
        to accumulate legacy cruft.
</p></li><li><p>The demand for Rust skills may be lower than that for
        the other two languages, but it is growing fast.  In
	general, all three languages are popular.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Carefully study the  <a href="../../slides/runtime/code/matmul">matrix
    multiplication</a> code for your chosen implementation language and
    think about what you need to do to adapt that code to handle this
    simpler project.
</p></li><li><p>Copy over the provided <code>prj2-sol</code> directory to your work
    directory.
</p></li><li><p>Copy over files from the matrix multiplication example for
    your chosen implementation language.  Rename files if necessary.
</p></li><li><p>Start making changes to the files.
</p><ul><li><p>First change the project build files to reference a vector
        addition project (rather than a matrix multiplication
        project).  Change your <code>make.sh</code> to run the build process.
</p><p>        [If editing a <code>Makefile</code>, please make sure that all lines
	which contain shell commands start with a tab character].
</p></li><li><p>If the code is based on multiple files (true for the C and C++
        matrix multiplication examples), then start with the files
        corresponding to lower-level code.  As you finish with a file,
        check it for compilations errors using something like <code>make</code>
        <em>file</em><code>.o</code>.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Ensure that your entire project compiles without <strong>any</strong> warnings.
</p></li><li><p>Update your <code>run.sh</code> to run your executable.  Note that you can
    use the shell variable <code>$@</code> to refer to the arguments your script
    was invoked with.
</p></li><li><p>Test your project via the command line as in the provided
     <a href="extras/LOG?lang=sh">LOG.</a>
</p></li><li><p>Test your parser using the provided scanner tests:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ ~/cs571/projects/prj2/extras/do-tests.sh run.sh
</pre><p>    Debug any failing tests.  Note that you can run a single test by
    adding an additional argument to the above command providing the
    path to the failing test.
</p></li><li><p>Iterate until you meet all requirements.
</p></li><li><p>Submit as in your previous project (the submission link should be
    available on gradescope next week).  Use the
     <a href="../../bin/do-zip.sh?lang=sh">~/cs571/bin/do-zip.sh</a> script
    along with a <code>.zipignore</code> to ensure that you do not submit
    binaries or garbage files.
</p></li></ol><p>If using git, it is always a good idea to keep committing your
project periodically to ensure that you do not accidentally lose work.
